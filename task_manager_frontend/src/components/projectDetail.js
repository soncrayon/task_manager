import React from 'react'

export const ProjectDetail = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            placeholder for project detail 
        </div>
    )
}

// TODO: pass the appropriate props based on the project that's clicked
// SOLUTION: is there a way to set up an action to update a dedicated key in state to hold this data
